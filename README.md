Machine learning algorithms involving deep neural networks have accumulated spectacular empirical successes over the recent years. Many of those accomplishments cannot be explained by conventional wisdom coming from standard learning theory. As the popularity of deep learning grows, the gap between theory and practice keeps widening. Building the groundworks for a satisfying theory of deep learning, with the ultimate goal of providing valuable insights to practitioners, is a major challenge in modern research.
